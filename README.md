# 🚀 Complete Backend Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Complete Backend Learning Journey** — a hands-on project built using **Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB**. This repository includes my backend practice work covering server-side development, RESTful routing, database operations, and user registration logic.

> 💡 **Goal:** Build a solid backend foundation by implementing real-world CRUD operations, routes, middleware, and templating using EJS and MongoDB.
